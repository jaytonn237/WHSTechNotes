Claim: My project idea is an AI Study Guide Generator that promotes ethical learning for middle school students. Evidence: This idea meets the challenge because the AI would responsibly scan a lesson's text and generate comprehension quizzes and summaries, not just give direct answers to homework, promoting ethical use. It helps in education by providing customized, instant review materials, making it a realistic and helpful tool. Reasoning: The project is useful because it reduces the time teachers spend creating supplemental materials while offering students immediate, personalized support. By focusing on comprehension, the AI ensures students are truly learning the material, thus helping the community succeed academically.

Claim: Computer science skills are now completely essential for a successful career in modern filmmaking and directing. Evidence: Directors constantly use computer science principles in specialized tools like pre-visualization (pre-vis) software, which models entire scenes and camera placements. For example, mapping a complex action sequence requires understanding 3D modeling and sometimes even writing custom scripts for virtual cinematography. Reasoning: This application is valuable because pre-vis allows the director to experiment with lighting and camera angles without wasting resources on a real set. Therefore, computer science expertise saves immense time and money, ensuring the director's vision is executed precisely and efficiently during production.

Claim: I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of employment. Evidence: The IKEA example shows that companies are willing to pay real wages, like $16.10 per hour, for virtual tasks such as restocking shelves and serving food in Roblox. Reasoning: This concept is excellent because it provides a flexible, low-barrier way for students or people who cannot easily commute to start earning. It also allows participants to gain valuable professional skills, such as customer service and collaboration, in a safer environment. Ultimately, virtual work expands access to job experience and income, helping to close opportunity gaps in the modern economy.

Before starting this course, I believed computer science was exclusively about writing complex code for finished software, like building games or mobile apps (Claim). My view has already begun to change, as the class has focused heavily on the foundational logic of computing and computational thinking rather than just programming syntax (Evidence). For instance, our deep dive into binary logic and algorithm efficiency demonstrated that CS is more about how computers fundamentally process information and solve problems than what the final product looks like (Evidence). This shift proves that computer science is truly a skill for organized problem-solving and abstraction, which is vital for many fields beyond technology (Reasoning). By focusing on these core concepts, I hope to gain a versatile, logical mindset that can be applied to solving problems efficiently in math, science, and even everyday life (Reasoning).
