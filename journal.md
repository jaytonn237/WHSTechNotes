Claim: My project idea is an AI Study Guide Generator that promotes ethical learning for middle school students. Evidence: This idea meets the challenge because the AI would responsibly scan a lesson's text and generate comprehension quizzes and summaries, not just give direct answers to homework, promoting ethical use. It helps in education by providing customized, instant review materials, making it a realistic and helpful tool. Reasoning: The project is useful because it reduces the time teachers spend creating supplemental materials while offering students immediate, personalized support. By focusing on comprehension, the AI ensures students are truly learning the material, thus helping the community succeed academically.

Claim: Computer science skills are now completely essential for a successful career in modern filmmaking and directing. Evidence: Directors constantly use computer science principles in specialized tools like pre-visualization (pre-vis) software, which models entire scenes and camera placements. For example, mapping a complex action sequence requires understanding 3D modeling and sometimes even writing custom scripts for virtual cinematography. Reasoning: This application is valuable because pre-vis allows the director to experiment with lighting and camera angles without wasting resources on a real set. Therefore, computer science expertise saves immense time and money, ensuring the director's vision is executed precisely and efficiently during production.

Claim: I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of employment. Evidence: The IKEA example shows that companies are willing to pay real wages, like $16.10 per hour, for virtual tasks such as restocking shelves and serving food in Roblox. Reasoning: This concept is excellent because it provides a flexible, low-barrier way for students or people who cannot easily commute to start earning. It also allows participants to gain valuable professional skills, such as customer service and collaboration, in a safer environment. Ultimately, virtual work expands access to job experience and income, helping to close opportunity gaps in the modern economy.

Before starting this course, I believed computer science was exclusively about writing complex code for finished software, like building games or mobile apps (Claim). My view has already begun to change, as the class has focused heavily on the foundational logic of computing and computational thinking rather than just programming syntax (Evidence). For instance, our deep dive into binary logic and algorithm efficiency demonstrated that CS is more about how computers fundamentally process information and solve problems than what the final product looks like (Evidence). This shift proves that computer science is truly a skill for organized problem-solving and abstraction, which is vital for many fields beyond technology (Reasoning). By focusing on these core concepts, I hope to gain a versatile, logical mindset that can be applied to solving problems efficiently in math, science, and even everyday life (Reasoning).

Technology fundamentally changes how people connect during the holidays, and while it improves long-distance connection, it must be used intentionally. (Claim) For example, video calling platforms like Zoom and shared photo albums allow family members who cannot travel to participate instantly in gift openings and special meals across hundreds of miles. (Evidence) This capability makes the holidays better by mitigating the sadness of physical separation, fostering inclusivity, and creating shared digital memories across generations. Because constant digital presence can erode in-person family time and privacy, developers should be responsible for integrating mandatory "focus modes" or strong, default privacy settings into new holiday tech, like smart toys and assistants. This is necessary because the tools they create inherently shift the balance of private versus shared time, and protecting that balance ensures the technology remains an asset, not a distraction.

 ran out of funding. SNAP helps millions of families buy groceries each month, so when funding runs out, many people struggle to afford healthy food.
Technology has already made a big difference in other areas like online shopping, delivery apps, and community alerts. Could it also help people find or access food when programs like SNAP are disrupted

 One job that uses drones is a drone pilot. Drone pilots fly drones to take pictures, make maps or inspect areas. programmers help by creating software that controls how drones fly and collect data. in texas, drone pilots can make around 50,000 to 75,000 a year. This job requires an FAA part 107 license. i would like this job becuase it uses technology and i would make alot of money.

 A self driving car might fail to stop for a school bus if its cameras or sensors do not clearly detect the stop arm or flashing lights. poor lighting, weather, or blocked views can make it harder for ai to recognize the bus. sofware errors can also cause the car to respond slow. one challenge is making sure ai understand bus rules. to improve saftey cars should use better cameras better sensors and emergency stop near buses would help protect people.
